# Precision_Medicine
Final project for the Precision Medicine Course

The AML.qmd file contains (for now) the pre-processing of the metadata/clinical
data and the counts data. In order for the script to run, you need to have the
"counts" folder in the same directory, which should contain the tsv files for
every patient selected.
